# Movie Composite Demo
## Description

I'm still working on this so like come back later or something. No guarantee it won't ever be good. The goal of the project is to illustrate usages of different data stores to more optimally serve and store data for a seemingly simple, easily understood data set such as movies and metadata surrounding.

The data source utilizes a subset of the TMDB data set on Films, Companies, Countries, Languages and Castings. 

## Prereq's
* Install sfdx
* Get you a dev hub org
* 

## Dev, Build and Test

* git clone dis
* set up sfdx - if you ain't already, get on the bandwagon and come back.
* sh automagic/automation.sh - take a look first make sure I'm not blowin yo stuf up, but basically it'll create a default scratch for you, deploy source, set up your permsets, and load some datas and run some more scripts. Maybe takes like 5m or so, so grab a quick coffee.
