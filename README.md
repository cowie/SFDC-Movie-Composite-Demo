# Movie Composite Demo
## Description

I'm still working on this so like come back later or something. No guarantee it won't ever be good. The goal of the project is to illustrate usages of different data stores to more optimally serve and store data for a seemingly simple, easily understood data set such as movies and metadata surrounding.

The data source utilizes a subset of the TMDB data set on Films, Companies, Countries, Languages and Castings.
